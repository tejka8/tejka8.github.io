        <b>Elementary school:</b>
        I started elementary school in 2009, in OOU „Goce Delcev”, Ilinden municipality. While laying the foundations of my education,
        I discovered within myself my passion for writing. I finished elementary school in 2018. The next few years I dedicated my time to writting stories, and applying to
        almost every writting contest out there.<br>
        <b>High school:</b>
        From 2018 to 2022 I was studying as an economic technician in <a href="https://vasilantevskidren.edu.mk/" target="_blank"> SEPUGS „Vasil Antevski – Dren ”</a>, Kisela Voda. During these four years of my education, I found
        out that I have an outstanding ability to be a good leader. In 2021,
        I won 3rd place at a state competition for a marketing plan in the following 2022 I also won
        2nd place at a state competition for a marketing plan for solar backpacks.<br>
