                It first started as a weight loss journey in 2020, but as time passed it grew into a habit and then it kind of became a hobby. The first couple of years I did body weight exercises at home, following exercising and nutrition plans. This helped me to lose 10 kilograms in just a year. After reaching my goal (weight wise) I started making my own nutrition plans to help me gain muscles. In May 2023, I started implementing weights in my workouts and the goal for me is by the end of this year to start weight lifting.

            Having a passion for art, food, and a healthy lifestyle helped me find myself in cooking.
            I devote most of my time to my breakfast, the most important thing for me is to start the day with a well-prepared
            and aesthetically pleasing meal. I am constantly trying to find and try new recipes. Currently, my biggest challenge is to
            try recipes from foreign cuisines mainly because of my childish tastebuds.
