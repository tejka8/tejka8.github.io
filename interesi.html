        <h1>Criminology</h1>
        <p id="int1">
            Growing up I had this weird obsession with being a forensic anthropologist or detective.
            This led me into being interested in murders and crimes. Almost every second of my free time I dedicate to
            listening to podcasts or reading about serial killers and/or current more severe cases of abuse and murders.
            I am amazed by how much information our bones hold about our whole existence, they “remember” every injury, trauma.
            They can pretty much expose our living habits and how we lived our life.

        <h1>Supernatural phenomena</h1>
        <p>If we consider the major that I’m studying it may seem absurd that
            I believe in such things. It was never proven that ghosts, shadow people and demons exist, but I
            am pretty sure they do. Ever since I was little, I used to watch shows about supernatural occurrences.
            At first, it was kind of disturbing, but as time passed it became more interesting for me. I strongly
            believe that being able to sense supernatural activities is a gift
            that not everyone has. Some things can’t be proven by science, that’s why you need to trust your intuition.
